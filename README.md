# Asili - Future of Fashion

# Project Introduction
African fashion designers have the potential of responding to the market but are held back by pre-production factors such as, obtaining the ideal design sketches and deciding which materials to employ for garment manufacture. Despite it being the most important phase of production many African fashion designers find the entire process to be time-consuming.

# Project Description
This project is aimed at automating the pre-production process so as to speed up the production process for fashion designers thus enabling fashion designers to respond to market demand swiftly.

# Targeted Users
African Fashion Designers
